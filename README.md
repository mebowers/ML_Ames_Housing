# Machine Learning Project: Ames Housing Data
This is my machine learning project for NYC Data Science Academy. The data I used was the Ames Real Estate dataset. I used this dataset to create, tune, and compare a series of linear regression and tree models, and to make model recommendations for different business cases.

## Data Overview
The data comes from the Ames Real Estate dataset, provided by the NYC Data Science Academy. It is a slightly smaller version of the Ames dataset created by Dean de Cock. It represents the kind of real estate data that a home buyer or real estate agent might use to understand and predict property values. The dataset is similar to other Ames Iowa datasets that can be found on Kaggle. For example: (Ames Iowa Housing Data)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcopale/housing]

## Project Highlights
I explored techniques for data imputation, outlier analysis, data transformations, feature reduction, and handling multicollinearity.

I used Pipelines to encode and preprocess my data for a series of MLR, penalized, and tree models. I investigated feature importances and SHAP values.

After tuning and refining each model, I evaluated them using cross-validation and examined performance, consistency, and reliability using my results to make recommendations for different business case scenarios.

This project was my first foray into machine learning.
